☐ Public HTTP API that gives external tools access to watched status updates  
  Should be a first-class citizen, as the tools have extended information about when it's a good time to be notified of a watched status and how best to render notifications  

☑ Switch to https://gitlab.com/artemciy/sqlite-mm  
☐ Implement `tt_status` update callbacks, invoking a handler that would check the `share_activity`  
  (That handler might be the `share_activity_step` except we're not calling it from a loop *yet*)  
→ ☐ Detect when the primary replica didn't handle the updates  
☑ Parse `/r share activity :busts_in_silhouette: with 668742126992883714 # PP`  
☑ Start `share_activity_loop`  
☑ fn on_presence_updateˢ: Implement the status reactions  
→ ☑ Update `tt_status` if there is a `share_activity` entry  
→ ☐ Invoke the hander, to be able to send/remove notifications and perform `share_activity` updates  
  ⇒ We should probably use the SQLite update callbacks instead  
☒ Shared HA master unavailability detection (cf. `track_time_step`)  
→ ☑ Consider not using the activity loop and simply reacting to the status events instead  
   Art sets :busts_in_silhouette:, then Maxim sets :busts_in_silhouette: - either only an immediate reaction right there,  
   or also a delayed reaction (say, every N minutes)?  
→ ☒ We could also reuse the `fn track_time_step` as is, invoking the `shared_activity_step` *from* it.  
☐ Parse `/r unshare activity :busts_in_silhouette: with 668742126992883714`  
→ ☐ "unshare" sounds as if we want to stop from notifying the `with` user about the activity, and maybe we should, to keep it simple  
→ ☐ Consequently, when the activity is first shared we should share it both ways, notifying the `with` user  

☐ Switching to a different channel with `/r track time` during an active status tracking leaves the previous channel's status message in an active state indefinitely, namely it doesn't have the 'zzz' inactivity marker.
We don't want this to happen, though we don't know yet how best to fix this.

☒ Verify that Sidekick can send a message to any user with a known ID or nick#hash  
  ⇒ I've [added a Create DM implementation](https://github.com/ArtemGr/discord-rs/commit/388db7b903d2ef1b765d0eb41013f75b25a12503) that allows us to create or obtain a private channel to user. There is now an experimental forwarding in `fn mobile`. It works with Art, but should probably test it with users who didn't communicate with Sidekick yet.  
  ⇒ So with Mateus `create_dm` worked NP but `send_message` failed with `Forbidden`. Looks like it's not enough to have a person in a friend list, one still have to [share a server with the bot](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49358108/in-discord-js-can-i-send-directmessage-to-user-with-discordbot). After Mateus joining such a server the message came through NP.
☐ Parse `/r share "pair programming" with 126848363613126656`  
☐ Parse `/r share "pair programming"`  
☐ Handle the `with` case  
☐ Generate a message and try to send it  
☐ If sending fails with `Forbidden` then share an invite link with the originating user  
☐ Detect when the targeted user becomes available (Discord ought to send a new user event)  
→ ☐ Track the identifiers of the users known to the bot?  
☐ Continue the process when the user becomes available, re-generate and re-send the message  
☐ Alternatively - just keep trying to send the message for a while  
…  

☐ Forward the private messages sent to the bot to _?
☐ Forward the replies, identified by _, back to the user?

☑ See if we're getting the status update events ⇒ Now we do  
☑ Handle `/r track time`  
☑ Reply with instructions (asking user to update the status)  
☑ Catch status updates in the shards, updating a separate status table, skipping duplicated events  
☑ Also catch when the user becomes idle, updating the same table  
☑ Run a maintenance loop in the handler  
☐ Use the SQLite callback to gather the IDs of recent status updates in order to process them faster  
☑ If the handler is a secondary one, then use the SQLite callback to monitor when the changes to the tracking table last happened; if the secondary handler don't observe any changes in the tracking table for N minutes then it performs its own maintenance run  
☐ Gather a list of entries to maintain: status updates ∪ *active* entries which hasn't been maintanied for N seconds  
☑ In a replicated session go over them and: update the status and the time it was discovered; update the last maintenance time; update the time histogram (86400 / 60 / 10 / 8 = 18 bytes/day; or RLE)  
☐ Go over the entries again, outside of a replicated session, and edit the reply messages, updating the time tracked and time remaining for a scheduled status update  
  If the status time is expired then we delete the reply message and recreate it, in order to trigger notification  

☑ Parse `/r share weeks 2020-1, 2020-2 from 789, 890 rate 33.3 with 123 # comment`  
  cf. https://www.epochconverter.com/weeks/2020  

☐ fishbowl reward (https://youtu.be/SROtK-LLZvQ?t=800, from 13:20 till 18:00) ?
