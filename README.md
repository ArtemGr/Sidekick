# Sidekick

2021-02-13. Discord is dropping websocket connections, no apparent reason, debugging the driver shows nothing suspicious on our side. Tried a bunch of other things (rebooting the server, increasing the number of shards to the recommended 164, rolling some of the changes back, regenerating the token) to no avail. I recommend switching to other bots.
