☐ Prototype a PDE running in repl.it  
“All your projects, instantly live. On Replit, there is no "deployment" stage of your projects-- we instantly host all of your repls”  
cf. https://docs.repl.it/misc/database (a shared stash that both the PDE and Sidekick can access?)

☐ Prototype a PDE running on GAE and NodeJS

sequence so far:  
1) PDE filter fires in the shard  
2) PDE server gets the message and replies with either  
  a) a reply to the user that needs no further processing from the bot  
  b) a modified (preprocessed) message  
     (turning `/r jake's health + 2d2` to `/r 33 + 2d2`)  
  c) not interested: server handler decided not to process the message  
3) If there's a reply or a modified message, they're passed to Sidekick handler  
4) Sidekick handler might log the PDE content and keep tabs on it  
  It sends the reply to the Discord (allowing for HTTP keepalive)  

☐ A command to register HTTP plugins  

    /r pde $yaml  # cf. https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/
      id: $short_unique_base36  # If ID exists then the PDE is updated
      channel: $id  # If the user knows the Discord ID then they're likely have some kind of access to the channel
      url: $http_url
      pk: $ct_pk  # If recipient's public key is present then Sidekick generates a key pair and shares the PDE public key
                  # Recepient will need that public key to open the messages and to encrypt the replies
      zstd: 3  # Compression level

→ ☐ Error message if the user is not a known patron  

☐ The question of moderation and of malicious content used to set the bot up  

☑ Upload WASMs into channels  
☑ `fn dice_io`: Load the set of WASM plugins for the channel.  
☑ → implement `fn wasm_plugins`  
☒ could] Get some positive V8 vibe from https://youtu.be/njt-Qzw0mVY.  
☑ `fn dice_io`: Explore WASM interpretation (inline function).  
☑ `fn dice_io`: Pass a WASM handler to `fn dice`.  
☐ `fn dice`: Run over the `input`, executing the WASM handler and the nom_inline_dice_notation.  
☒ → Communicate with Node.js via stdin/out pipe. ⇒ Hard to do around blocking I/O and with proper failure modes.  
☒ → https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche  
☑ → → Commit wasm-server.js for future reference and mention it in quic.md  
☑ Consider reusing some of the [Cloudflare docs and tools](https://workers.cloudflare.com/docs/tutorials/build-a-rustwasm-function/) to program the WASM  
☑ → How about using the Cloudflare workers to serve the WASM in the first place? That is, instead of running the Node.js locally we'll simply host the WASMs as the Cloudflare workers! Meaning that the users will be able to develop Sidekick extensions with any HTTP server, Cloudflare workers is simply a solution we'll use as an example and for our own development experiments ⇒ They're working fine, though one needs to proxy a site via the Cloudflare to get the workers.  
☑ → Evaluate https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/rust-runtime-for-aws-lambda/  
    They have [VSCode extension](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudiocode/)  
    They have S3 and DynamoDB and Simple Notification Service  
    ⇒ Amazon created an EC2 instance to host the lambda, which has to be kept up and running for the lambda function to work (and was pain in the ass to disable), which is kind of different from on-demand computing I expected of it. And it's weird that they seem to take money for both the instance and the lambda computing time, and 100ms minimum at that.

☒ Communicate with Node.js via HTTP  
☑ Move shard-handler communication to HTTP, https://github.com/ArtemGr/Sidekick/issues/195  
☑ → Hyper server, [fast](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&hw=ph&test=plaintext)  
☑ → Port `ShardStatusPt::dispatch`  
☑ Move SQLite synchronization to HTTP  
☑ Move mobile-handler communication to HTTP  
  We should eventually use something like the https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging to get notifications, in order to save battery and traffic and RAM, but for now we can just reuse the bidirectional HTTP communication, leaving the push optimization for later
